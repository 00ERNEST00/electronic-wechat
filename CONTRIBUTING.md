# Contributing to Electronic WeChat

## Issues

- Check if your issue is already [there](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/electronic-wechat). 
  
- Check if your issue is `Electronic WeChat` related rather than `electron` related. Here are some of the issues acknowledged by [`electron`](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/).
  
  - IME positions way off your input when you are typing the first character. See [electron issue #4539](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/4539).
  - Window blinks on resize. See [brightray issue #196](https://github.com/atom/brightray/issues/196).
  - Cannot reload. Reloading was disable by me because of [electron issue #4324](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/4324).
  
  I will keep close attention to these issues and will update as soon as there is a fix.
  
- Follow the guide in the issue template.
